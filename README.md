# BurgerOfTheDay
Unique burger log using MySQL, Node, Express, and Sequelize.

# Instructions
Enter a unique burger name and click the green button to add your burger to the list. The burger then is added to the database, and appears in the available list of burgers that are ready to be devoured. When the devoured button is clicked, the burger is moved over to the devoured side, and is no longer available.

## Challenges 
I, as a front-end developer, struggle with the back end. Sequelize is not my friend. Everytime I try to use it, I end up not being able to connect to anything due to errors within code in the node modules, and files that weren't set up by me. I don't know what I am doing wrong to run into these errors. 

## Future Developments 
When I am a famous front-end developer I will find a back-end developer friend and never have them work on this homework because the concept seems underdeveloped and the application is entirely unneccessary. 

However, I really wanted to spend my time learning how to use Lottie ios from AirBnB, and BodyMovin which parses AfterEffects SVGs into JSON files to render vector animations. 

## Contributing
Matt Beachy helped me during class. He also didn't know why I was getting errors. 

I found a great little free cheeseburger illustration from Filip Gre≈° on Dribbble. I really wish I could have animated it.
